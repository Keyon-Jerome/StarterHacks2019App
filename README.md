# StarterHacks2019App
App for StarterHacks2019.
##Inspiration
We identified our problem that we wanted to solve by speaking with KidsAbility and analyzing their Impact Partner prompt statement 1.

##What it does
Our app allows a staff member to track and monitor other staff members' locations to and from their visits to clients using the Google Maps API. The user can see today's schedule and the staff members who are working today, with their Bitmoji as their profile picture. The manager has the additional option to import a calendar from Google or Outlook to set new appointment times for their staff members. All staff members have an alert button to contact other staff members for help if there is a problem during their visit to their client. The manager will also be notified if staff members' GPS location shows that they are still at the client's house past the scheduled time slot and when they arrive safely back at KidsAbility.

##How I built it
Wireframes were created using Figma, Android Studio was used to code the app, and SnapKit features (specifically login and Bitmoji) was integrated as well.

C##hallenges I ran into
Finding a problem, refining our solution to it, integrating the Snap Kit, and debugging a new language that we just learned.

##Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned more about Figma, worked with Android Studio and Snap Kit for the first time

W##hat I learned
Teamwork, Android Studio, UX/UI design, Snap Kit

##What's next for TRACK
User testing, 3rd party integration
